# How to interact with FT from smart contract

The smart contract exposes for methods to show how to interact with FTs from smart contract in different ways.

# Quickstart

1. Make sure you have installed [rust](https://rust.org/).
2. Install the [`NEAR CLI`](https://github.com/near/near-cli#setup)

<br />

## 1. Build and Deploy the Contract
You can automatically compile and deploy the contract in the NEAR testnet by running:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Once finished, check the `neardev/dev-account` file to find the address in which the contract was deployed:

```bash
cat ./neardev/dev-account
# e.g. dev-1659899566943-21539992274727
```
